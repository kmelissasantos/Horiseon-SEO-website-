# Horiseon-SEO-website-
Description
This website was refractored to be more accessible while maintaining the current look of the website. The HTML and CSS were refractored to be cleaner 
and more conscise while also touching up the structure of the code to be more condensed and cleaner for the next person to edit it. 
There are links at the top right of the page which are now clickable and take you to the correct area of the site.
